# Quantum Optical Flow
Project for Master Thesis in "Applied Computer Science, Machine Learning and Big Data" in University of Naples Parthenope.
It's still in early stage of development.
The goal is to leverage Adiabatic Quantum Computing to solve the dense optical flow algorithm thanks to Dwave Quantum Solvers.
